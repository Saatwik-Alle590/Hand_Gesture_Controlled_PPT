Hand Gesture Controlled PPT 


Summary:

The objective of the proposed hand gesture-controlled PowerPoint (PPT) system is to transform traditional presentations by introducing an intuitive and interactive method of control. 
This innovative system eliminates the need for conventional input devices, fostering enhanced interactivity and allowing presenters to effortlessly manage their presentations through natural hand gestures. 
The system is designed to facilitate actions such as slide navigation, emphasizing key points, and triggering animations, thus creating dynamic and immersive presentations that significantly improve audience engagement and comprehension. 
Emphasis is placed on personalization, customization, seamless integration with popular presentation software, and promoting accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments or disabilities, ensuring that presenters of all backgrounds and abilities can deliver presentations with ease and independence.

The proposed system leverages machine learning, hand gesture detection, and gesture recognition libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe to form a robust foundation. 
By addressing the limitations of existing systems, the proposed solution aims to enhance accuracy and responsiveness, recognize a broader range of hand gestures, and offer integration with multiple presentation platforms beyond Microsoft PowerPoint. 
Furthermore, the system introduces additional functionalities like zooming, highlighting, and customizable gesture sets, providing a more adaptable and personalized interaction experience for presenters. Overall, the hand gesture-controlled PowerPoint system strives to revolutionize presentations, making them more interactive, personalized, and accessible for presenters and audiences alike.
